🕸️ Silk: See the Strings


Silk is a lightweight web app that helps users identify subtle forms of emotional manipulation—like gaslighting, guilt-tripping, and deflection—through guided questions and instant feedback.

Built as a personal tool and a public resource, Silk is designed for anyone who’s ever felt like something was off in a conversation but couldn’t quite name it. Inspired by the metaphor of being "caught in a web" of unseen dynamics, Silk helps users recognize the emotional patterns that can keep them stuck.

✨ What it does:
Offers a 60-second interactive quiz to flag manipulative behaviors

Uses simple checklists + reflective prompts to build awareness

Provides instant results categorized by type (gaslighting, blame-shifting, etc.)

Encourages emotional clarity and boundary-setting
